# Golang Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for various coding challenges from **Codewars** in Golang. Each folder corresponds to a different **Kyu** (difficulty level), and each solution is stored in its own `.go` file. The tests are written in Go's built-in testing framework to validate the correctness of the solutions.

## Folder Structure

- `8kyu/`: Easy level challenges (e.g., simple math, string manipulations).
- `7kyu/`: Medium level challenges (e.g., more complex algorithms and data structures).
- `6kyu/`: Advanced level challenges.

## Running Tests

To run the tests in this repository, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Go (if you haven't already)

If you don't have Go installed, follow the official installation guide for your operating system:  
[Go Installation Guide](https://golang.org/doc/install)

### 2. Clone the Repository

If you haven't cloned the repository yet, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Druashley/golang-solutions.git
cd golang-solutions
```
